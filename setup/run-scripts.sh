# module: the demos (demos/module_NN, except the 99- scripts), then the exercise (its
# starting scripts, exercises/module_NN/check.sh, which must exit with 1 on the starting
# state, the scripts of solution/, then check.sh again, which must exit with 0), then the
# demos' 99- scripts, which give the lab back as setup/install.sh left it.
# A .sql script names its instance in its first five lines ("-- instance: rpllab2") and
# runs there; a .sh script runs as it is, from the root of the repository. A script whose
# first five lines contain "ci: skip" (it stops the lab, waits for the Agent, needs a
# failure provoked by hand) is not run.
# Usage: ./setup/run-scripts.sh [module_NN ...]     (with Podman: ENGINE=podman ...)
